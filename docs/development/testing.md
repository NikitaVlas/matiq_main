# Testing strategy

## Objectives

Define the risks the project's test suite must control.

## Unit tests

Test business rules and isolated deterministic logic.

## Integration tests

Test databases, file systems, adapters, framework integration, and boundaries.

## Contract tests

Test public APIs, schemas, messages, and external integration assumptions.

## E2E tests

Test critical user journeys through production-like boundaries.

## Visual tests

When UI exists, test key states and supported viewports against approved design.

## Manual tests

Use only when automation is disproportionate or cannot establish confidence.

## Regression policy

A reproducible bug fix must include a regression test when technically feasible.

## Test matrix

| Change                        | Minimum expected test           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Business rule                 | Unit                            |
| Database query or repository  | Integration                     |
| API endpoint or event         | Integration and/or contract     |
| Critical user flow            | E2E                             |
| Bug fix                       | Regression                      |
| Migration                     | Migration integration           |
| UI state                      | Component and/or E2E            |
| Visual change                 | Screenshot comparison           |
| Authentication or permissions | Integration plus negative cases |
| External integration          | Contract plus failure behavior  |

## Test rules

- Test observable behavior, not incidental implementation details.
- Do not remove tests to make CI pass.
- Do not silently weaken assertions.
- Include negative cases for critical operations.
- Keep tests independent and reproducible.
- Control time, randomness, network access, and shared state.
- Keep fixtures free of real secrets and sensitive production data.
